# Data Gathering
In this step, the data will be gathered and processed (making ready) for the cnn model feeding.
Our dataset has the json file that describes the classes of each image and with this info we classify them on. We also resize whole dataset as 32x32 which is minimum acceptable resolution for many famous models.
